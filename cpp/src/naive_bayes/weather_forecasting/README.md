# Naive Bayes Weather Forecasting (C++)

This module implements a Naive Bayes classifier for a simple weather forecasting dataset.
The focus is on computing prior probabilities, likelihoods, and using them to make predictions.

---

## Objective

- Compute prior probabilities for the target variable
- Compute likelihoods for feature values conditioned on each class
- Use priors and likelihoods to predict the most likely forecast

---

## Context

Naive Bayes is a probabilistic classification algorithm based on Bayes’ Theorem and the assumption of conditional independence between features.

This task represents a foundational step toward:
- Probabilistic modeling
- Classification systems
- Bayesian reasoning in machine learning

---

## Notes

- This module belongs to machine learning fundamentals.
- It is independent of gradient-based optimization methods.
- The structure allows easy extension with smoothing and additional features.
